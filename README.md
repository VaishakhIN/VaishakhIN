Real-Time Updates: After each move, the interface updates immediately to show the current state of the board and whose turn it is.

Win Detection: The game automatically detects winning conditions (three in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) and announces the winner.

Draw Detection: If all cells are filled without a winner, the game declares a draw.

Restart Functionality: A reset button allows players to clear the board and start a new game without restarting the application.

Visual Feedback: Winning combinations are highlighted, and the board disables further input once the game is won or drawn.

Cross-Platform: Runs on any platfor.
